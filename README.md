# 🔍 Java Coding Assessment – Problem Set by Diana Musee

This repository contains Java solutions to 7 algorithmic coding questions I completed as part of a timed technical assessment for a Junior Developer role. Each solution was written from scratch with a focus on readability, logic, and efficiency. I included inline comments, test cases, and a runnable `Main` class to demonstrate results for each question.

The project handles tasks like rotating lists, validating brackets, detecting unique entries, and computing gaps or frequencies — useful real-world patterns in software development.

## 📌 Questions Implemented

### ✅ Question 1: Find Unique Pairs That Sum to a Target
### ✅ Question 2: Validate Bracket String
### ✅ Question 3: Anagram Checker
### ✅ Question 4: First Unique Product
### ✅ Question 5: Minimum Distance Between Duplicate Minimums
### ✅ Question 6: Top 3 Most Frequent Words
### ✅ Question 7: Rotate List to the Right (Now works with `List<String>`)

Each question is modularized in its own `.java` file under the `Questions/` directory.
